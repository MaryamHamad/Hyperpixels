#####  The main steps of the proposed 4D LF over-segmentation method. Given a 4D LF and the corresponding disparity maps for all views, initial centroids characterized by distinct features are assigned in the reference view/views. Next, hyperpixels are generated by iteratively applying 4D K-means clustering, including pixel labeling, centroids adjustment and clustering weights adaptation, until convergence is reached.
